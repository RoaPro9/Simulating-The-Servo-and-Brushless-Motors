Simulating The Servo and Brushless motors using Tinkercad.com

## How to wire the Servo motors:
### Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno R3 Board
- Servo Micro Motor
- hook-up wires

### Circuit
Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal. The power wire is normally red and should be linked to the Arduino board's 5V pin. The ground wire is normally and attached to a ground pin on the board. The signal pin is usually yellow and should be linked to the board's PWM pin. Pin number -11 is used in these examples.
